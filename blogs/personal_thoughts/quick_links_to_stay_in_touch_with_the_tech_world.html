        <p><i>Posted on 07/10/2018</i></p>

        <p>It’s hard to keep up with the advancement of <b>technology</b>. Every single day, there is quite interesting
            news that a technical person should be interested in and be aware of; from industrial to developer news.
            Hence I wanted to share couple of links of websites and mention some Android applications that provide daily
            tech news so you are always up-to-date.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><a class="link2" href="https://www.codeproject.com/Feature/Insider/" target="_blank">CodeProject – The
                    Daily Insider</a>
                <p>“<i>CodeProject was formed to provide developers with a place to meet and exchange ideas. We hope to
                        provide developers with all the resources they need to help them in their day to day

                </p>
                <p>I wanted to share this website the most because it provides concise and relevant news and information
                    to keep me up-to-date every day. So, their Daily Insider feature is a free E-mail-based subscription
                    system where they send an E-mail everyday containing all kinds of tech news that worth reading from
                    different sources so you also get the chance to find good bloggers out there.
                    I highly recommend you subscribing to <a class="link2"
                        href="https://www.codeproject.com/Feature/Insider/" target="_blank">Daily Insider</a> so you

                </p>
                <p>
                    Their previous app called <b>AppyGeek</b> was the main source for my daily tech news as I used to
                    check it out every morning on my way to university. However they stopped continuing AppyGeek and
                    created a whole different news app revolving around many topics, not only tech but sports, politics
                    etc… </p>
