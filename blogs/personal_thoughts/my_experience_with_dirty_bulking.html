        <p class="Header">My Experience with Dirty Bulking</p>
        <p><i>Posted on 18/11/2018</i></p>

        <p>First of all, we need to understand what bulking is. In simple terms, bulking is a process of gaining both
            muscle mass and body fat by consuming caloric surplus every day which should be around 250-500 calories more
            than your maintenance calorie intake. <a class="link" href="https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html"
                target="_blank"> Calculate yours here</a>.</p>

        <p>Usually, people who have been going to the gym for a few years will be going through the bulking and cutting
            cycle. However they fall into the illusion of ‘<i>as long as I consume enough calories I’m good</i>’. So
            they eat whatever they feel like regardless of counting calories and nutrients properly. And that is
            ‘<i>dirty bulking</i>’. Consequently, I also happened to be fallen into this illusion and experienced some
            benefits but mostly drawbacks.</p>

        <p>One of the benefits of dirty bulking is that you gain weight faster which makes you stronger and because of
            the high amount of carbohydrate and fat consumption, you also happen to have a lot of energy so you can stay
            in gym for longer and get even stronger. The other good thing is that as you eat literally anything you
            desire, you will always be eating delicious food including junk and unhealthy food.
        </p>

        <p>However the drawbacks start from having a big belly, of course if you only care about the strength you
            gaining then it’s not a big problem however if you’re into aesthetics it doesn’t serve the purpose of the
            whole cutting and bulking cycle as when you hit the cutting stage it’s going to be very difficult to lose
            that belly and other fatty areas like arms, legs and the face especially. There is also the fact of not
            breathing properly, as you consume junk after junk and unhealthy fats in your body, you will start to be out
            of breath quicker and start snoring in your sleep. Also, dirty bulking can create this way of eating a habit
            which can go as bad as to hitting the levels of obesity. For some people it might be harder to switch from
            bulking to a normal way of eating let alone the cutting stage so it’s not even worth to go through this
            whole process. </p>

        <p>In conclusion, if you’re going to bulk, you got to do it in a right and a clean way for long-term purposes. I
            strongly advise clean bulking so you won’t be so out of shape and still gain strength at the same time. I
            obviously do not say that you can’t eat any junk food or anything, however please do count your nutrients
            and consume any junk once or twice a week and make this a lifestyle rather than a diet. </p>
