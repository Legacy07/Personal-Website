        <p class="Header">How HackerRank helped me</p>
        <p><i>Posted on 27/01/2019</i></p>

        <p>I was fresh out of University, got my degree in my hand and wondering if I was capable enough for a
            developer job. At that time, I didn’t feel like I was ready to start working hence I took some time off
            focusing on my programming skills. Before I found out <a class="link" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/"
                target="_blank">HackerRank</a>, I worked on
            personal projects and deployed my website to showcase my portfolio so I stand out from other candidates
            where the competition in this industry for a graduate is very high. After a month, I decided to start
            applying for jobs and focus on improving my skills in Algorithms and all kinds of data structures as I knew
            it will help me out in interviews alongside with general development of my technical skills. </p>

        <p>Then I found out <i>HackerRank</i>, I started practicing and solving algorithmic problems 2 days a week,
            also I had
            to work on other projects so I needed to manage my time in this way. At first, even though I have been
            programming for 3 years, worked on several university and personal projects, I struggled with solving basic
            algorithmic problems. This made me realise how unpractical I was and it sort of demoralised me as I reckon
            this was normal because of the fact that I was confident in my capabilities. However, I had to push through
            and stay committed so, within a short period of time, basics were a piece of cake as it should’ve been from
            day one. Consequently I started with medium problems and by this time I landed my first-ever interview for
            a developer role and got rejected. </p>

        <p>I kept on working on HackerRank and my projects until I landed my first-ever developer role after 4 months
            of job hunting and 7 rejections. What I can suggest to fresh technical graduates is that, if you want a
            developer career and feel like you are not ready for it, then all you will be doing is delaying because you
            can never be 100% ready for anything, instead start applying for jobs and work on your technical knowledge
            which I developed an <b>Android</b> application just for this purpose - <a class="link"
                href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ahmet.interviewapp" target="_blank">Interview
                Revision</a> and adding practicality which HackerRank can help you upon.
            There are other similar platforms out to help you develop your programming skills but HackerRank was the
            one that I found useful. </p>

        <p>I mainly used <a class="link" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit"
                target="_blank">Interview
                Preparation Kit</a> and <a class="link"
                href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=problem-solving"
                target="_blank">Problem Solving</a>
            categories which I think you should be start working on solving the problems and develop your algorithmic
            knowledge. </p>
