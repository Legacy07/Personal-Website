            <p class="BoxDescription">Everybody have their top movies that they can recall whenever it’s
                asked
                around
                hence I wanted to list my favourite movies of all time (without spoiling) which I
                believe most
                of the
                people will agree to. In this list, majority of the movies aren’t going to be recent as
                I don’t
                know if
                this is a psychological thing towards me liking the ‘nostalgia’ or the fact that movies
                in the
                modern
                era aren’t trying to portray a message/lesson and/or haven’t got their story plot up to
                a par as
                the
                movies in late 1900s and early 2000s.</p>

                <b>Gson</b>
                library because it converts objects to JSON and this helps with saving its state in
                Shared
                Preferences.
                So, if you need to save some data from your list and display it after the app is

                took some
                time off
                focusing on my programming skills. Before I found out <a class="link" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/"

                your
                pocket. I understand the
                needs
                and urges as it comes costly and this makes it harder for a young person to manage their
                spending even
                if
                you’re
                receiving student finance. Consequently, the more money you have the more you spend hence you
                become
                broke
                within 2 weeks. So, most likely, you will probably look for a job to earn extra cash so you
                survive for
                the
                month.</p>
