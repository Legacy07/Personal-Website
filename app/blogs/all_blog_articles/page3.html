            <p class="BoxDescription">Who doesn’t like cheat days in a cutting season? I certainly do. It’s one
                of those
                pleasures that no one
                should know of. To be honest, you wouldn’t even have the need to cheat on your diet or your
                healthy
                lifestyle if you consume just enough of everything in a healthy fashion. Unless you have serious
                goals
                and
                determination, it’s essential not to cheat often or ever during the season.</p>

                cardio in order to get to a certain lean level.</p>
