        <p class="Header">Cardio, Cardio, Cardio</p>
        <p><i>Posted on 28/06/2019</i></p>

        <p>As an avid gym guy, I’ve fallen into the trap of not doing cardio as I thought that would make me lose ‘all
            the gainz’. This had some truth in it, however the realization hit me when the only solution was to do
            cardio in order to get to a certain lean level. I’ve watched many videos of numerous bodybuilders hitting
            their cardio 3-4 times a day of 30-40 minutes each session explaining how useful and effective cardio is.
            Yet, I still managed to not start running, well I kind of did but 10 minutes after every workout. This
            didn’t make much of a progress to me, unless you’re over 100 kg and plus, this type of cardio will not get
            you to anywhere. So, with the help of setting a goal for getting shredded abs for the summer, I pushed
            myself for the first cardio session that lasted for 3 minutes of running and 5 minutes of incline walking.
            Bearing in mind that I was out of breath after 3 minutes. I mean, I wasn’t always the guy with the
            long-lasting stamina at school and achieve 20 in bleep tests (never mind if you haven’t studied in the UK,
            level 20 is basically Mo Farah level). Though, I unironically totally blame this to my intense workout
            session that took all my energy out of me before jumping on the treadmill machine. </p>

        <p>Luckily, right after I made the decision for running, I found myself signing up for a 5k charity run at work
            which was organized by the man himself Peter Marx – you can also donate if you wish so
            <a class="link" href="https://dressember5k19.funraise.org/fundraiser/peter-marx"
                target="_blank">dressember</a>. Again, bear in mind that I never done a 5k
            run
            which can be very surprising to some people considering that avid runners do these numbers in their dreams.
            However, this was a big step for me, and I had to train for it. So, after every workout session, I jumped on
            the treadmill and put a minute more than what I did the previous day. This accumulated to 17 minutes of pure
            running before the 5k run that I can say helped me out a lot. Finally, we’ve all completed the 5k run and I
            took a long break, as long as 2 months… No excuses, I messed up, but I came back to it and started running
            again which made me feel so better, clean and fresh. Besides working out, which minimised to as little as
            twice
            a week, I’m giving 2 days for cardio alone where I’m running 26 minutes straight now and hitting my
            Personal best’s day by day. </p>

        <p>From 3 minutes to 26 minutes in just a few months… Honestly, even though I haven’t hit my goal yet, this
            shows if you really want to achieve something, you must start now, and now only. With being patient,
            positive and persistent, you can achieve whatever you placed in your vision to. Make that goal your mission
            and go grab it. But, enjoy it on the way too. Don't become miserable.</p>
