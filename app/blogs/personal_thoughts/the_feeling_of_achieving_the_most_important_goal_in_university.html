        <p class="Header">The Feeling of Achieving the Most Important Goal in University</p>
        <p><i>Posted on 07/07/2019</i></p>

        <p>Goals, goals, goals. Everyone has their own specific short or long-term rather realistic or unrealistic
            goals. This can vary depending on their situation, lifestyle, desire and vision. And, of course most people
            with dedication will achieve their goals, not all but some. Hence, I wanted to share how I achieved the most
            important goal in my university with the hopes of inspiring the fellow students to commit on whatever they
            are trying to achieve. </p>

        <p>So, it was the first day of my 3rd year, and the classic question came up from my tutor “Have you guys struck
            a thought of your final year projects?”. Some already figured out what they were going to work on. I was one
            of them. I had this one very idea which I wanted to work on in an Android platform where at the time I had
            no experience of. Thus, I wanted to wait a little, while my brain can come up with other project ideas that
            I could potentially do on a platform where I have some experience at the least. However, I subconsciously
            was so into wanting to work on this project that I knew this will be the most fun I will have in creating an
            app because for some reason I developed this passion for wanting to work on Android apps. And the main
            reason why I demanded for this very specific idea was because I had it in mind in summertime already.</p>

        <p>After a casual walk on the way home from a hardcore session at gym, an idea of my little brother being
            kidnapped came around for some weird reason. I had this for couple of days and figured out that I can build
            an application based around Emergency notification service. Hence, I wanted to keep this idea for my final
            year project and then start learning android alongside with developing too. My tutor tried to enforce the
            idea of working on a project in a platform where you have experience in which was mostly what university
            have taught. And, he wasn’t wrong. Rationally, it makes sense not to spend any more time in learning because
            this is where you showcase what you’ve learnt throughout the academic years. However, in order for me to
            fully get the satisfaction of achieving the optimal goal at the end of the year, as a means to achieving a
            certain mark in First class, I had to go with something that I will be happy and passionate of doing. </p>

        <p>So, I went with the idea, started the dissertation by researching about the project behind the application in
            the first term then fully banged on developing the application whilst learning at the same time for most
            days in the week in the second term. Though, things weren’t going so well… I had a one-to-one private
            session every week, just like everyone else, with our tutor to ensure that both sides know the progress and
            are on the right track. Most of these sessions went with quite a roasting session by my tutor about how I
            will be passing the year but not getting over 2.2 and that it was just so average. Maybe I couldn’t express
            the idea fully or wasn’t really able to show to progression in those sessions or it was just the fact that
            he didn’t want me to be in my comfortable zone and push me to the point where I can be like ‘yeah, I proved
            him wrong’. Yet, he showed me how I can do some things to achieve more marks. And to be honest, I believe it
            all worked out at the end. </p>

        <p>Finally, I submitted my 15k+ words dissertation alongside with my working Android application then settled to
            wait for the results. I somehow had the feeling of achieving what I wished and worked for after 3 years
            because I fully knew I put in the time and effort into it in order to accomplish “the” goal. But I also had
            negative thoughts which I couldn’t hold my self not to think about it, where I doubted my abilities and
            asked the question “what if?” … What if couldn’t make it, what if I couldn’t achieve it, what if I didn’t
            work as hard as I thought I did? As the time was flying past, the tension and the anxiety was getting
            stronger. But it all ended on that day, just like any other day when I was checking my university portal to
            see if the results been uploaded or not. I was happy first of all, but also excited, had goose bumps and
            felt proud of myself accomplishing what I worked for throughout the years and not just because I received
            the first class honours, but it all did worth it after the sacrifices I made and being very consistent and
            determined even after such setbacks and failures of not being making progress. It made me realise, might
            sound cliché but you can achieve whatever you put in your mind, and keeping the 3 P’s (Patience, Positivity,
            Persistence) under your hood will make you succeed if you have the vision and the mission of what you will
            be doing no matter what the goal is.</p>
