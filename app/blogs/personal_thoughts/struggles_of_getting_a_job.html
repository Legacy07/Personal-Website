        <p class="Header">Struggles of Getting a Job</p>
        <p><i>Posted on 21/06/2019</i></p>

        <p>It has been some time I haven’t posted but I’m back on the blog grind. Most Probably will post once a week
            again but will try not to miss a week from now on as I have skipped almost 3 months. Though, in the meantime
            I didn’t step back working on my projects, so we got to stay committed. Right? Yet, sometimes you prioritize
            things higher than others, so this was quite the situation plus not going to lie there was a bit of laziness
            and lack of interest in writing anything. However, I really wanted to write about the struggles of finding a
            job and getting interviews even because I know how shitty it is not being able to work which after a while
            makes you feel like you are not competent enough.</p>

        <p>Obviously, finding a job is not easy at all, especially for graduates in a high value market like Technology.
            Unless you graduated from one of the top universities then you are most likely to be jobless for at least 2
            months to a year. Though, this shouldn’t demotivate or depress you. You can use this time to build your CV
            and personal portfolio which will ultimately help you out finding a better job than you expect and give you
            a head start than others who sit their asses home and watch movies all day long. If you absolutely do not
            need to work, I mean unless you live by yourself trying to survive then go find a part-time job but don’t
            let this distract you from the fact that it is going to take you a lot longer to start your career. I see a
            lot of graduates either starting a part-time job unnecessarily or sit home doing nothing, instead you can
            use this valuable time to develop yourself characteristically and expand your knowledge. </p>

        <p>You won’t find a job if you try applying for a few job applications a day. You should act as if it’s your job
            and spend hours, and I mean like 9 to 5. This will allow you to develop your CV to a better standard and
            polish it for every distinct job application. Never send the same CV to every job post you apply to. Be
            <b>persistent</b> with it and keep working, researching and developing every single day.
        </p>

        <p>Being <b>positive</b> is a huge factor. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to carry the stress of not being able
            to get
            into interviews and/or the rejections from interview after interview. You should remind yourself that you
            will get into a job, simply. Because this is what the reality is, the human brain tends to overreact to
            distress and gives us the illusion that it will last a life-long which is far from the reality. Therefore,
            you got to stay positive and be confident in yourself that would start working some-time in the future,
            could be in a week or a month.</p>

        <p>Lastly, <b>patience</b>. No dream, goal, a desire happens overnight. Just like everything else, job hunting
            will
            take quite some time. It all depends on the time. This doesn’t mean you can’t speed up things which I
            explained above but again; you won’t be able to start your career in a week. So being patient goes with
            being positive and vice-versa. These two will ensure you don’t demotivate and distress yourself. Even though
            motivation is a limited factor, commitment is what will make you achieve things.
        </p>
        <p> So, don’t forget the 3 P’s;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Persistence</b></li>
            <li><b>Positivity</b></li>
            <li><b>Patience</b></li>
        </ul>
