        <p class="Header">Muscle Crate Review</p>
        <p><i>Posted on 30/08/2019</i></p>

        <p>In this day and age, it’s pretty much very possible to find a <a class="link"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box" target="_blank">loot box</a>
            in every category. So, this is no different and the idea is to send
            out selected products every month to monthly subscribers. In this case, Muscle Crate boxes contain a kg of
            protein powder and all kinds of products from protein bars to creatine samples etc. Obviously, there are
            different subscription boxes but I’m only reviewing what I’m receiving. </p>

        <p>With this subscription box, you can choose either ‘<i>Chocolate Type</i>’ or ‘<i>Fruit Type</i>’ for protein
            powder
            flavors, so because I got fed up with chocolate flavor and desired to try out different kinds of flavors, I
            chose ‘Fruit Type’ and kept that selection for couple of months now. This month, I received a kg tub of
            protein powder which was full ‘vegan’, didn’t really looked up for its price but vegan products are quite
            pricey normally. Also, the flavor was ‘Cinnamon Churro’, I was disgusted when I read cinnamon on the label
            however, I still wanted to give a try and see how it goes, surprisingly enough I quite liked its ‘rich
            flavor’ and thickness. Besides that, I received couple of other samples ranging from protein powders,
            creatine, pre-workout, bcaa and aminos. Also, I received a packet of protein cookies that costs £4 on their
            site. In total I normally receive 8-12 different products including samples and products. One time I
            received protein Nutella and some other month received 250g of protein powder. Every month I also find these
            500ml of pre-workout drinks too. </p>

        <p>I always wanted this sort of loot boxing in this category, it’s nice to try out different products, brands
            and flavors. I believe it very much is worth the money as they really send out premium quality protein
            powders that is at least £18 and above and with all the other samples and products, it’s well hitting the
            £30 mark and most probably above as well. </p>
