            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zD-3j2g9w9U" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"

        <p>If you’re struggling with boosting and maintaining energy, I highly suggest you try the ‘daily bio-energizer’
            after you wake up and/or when you are on the way to gym.</p>

        <p>I’ve been following <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/strengthcamp" target="_blank">Elliot
                Hulse</a> for quite some time because of his perspective in life at the same time acquiring some
            advices, benefiting from his wisdom and inspiration, also for these sorts of exercises which he learnt
            throughout his journey in building his character and spirit. Even though this video is quite old, I recently
            found this gem and started applying in most of the days in a week for the past month. So, my morning goes
            like this; wake up, drink 2 glasses of water, brush teeth and perform the ‘bio-energizer’. After 20-25
            minutes of this morning routine, my energy level goes up drastically and I do not think you will reach this
            level with your morning coffee (which I used to drink a full cup of coffee and still feel down, tired and
            sleepy). Let alone the energy boost, stretching your body opens up the soreness and the muscle blockages
            which makes you more flexible and allowing yourself to breathe properly which is a very important aspect
            that we tend to not breathe correctly in our daily lives.
        </p>

        <p>However, it was difficult to start the exercises in the beginning hence I applied "<a class="link"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEnHzV9XpL0" target="_blank">The Law of 3’s</a>" where you have
            the mind-set of committing of doing something for 3 days only, once 3 days is gone by, now you plan ahead
            for 3 weeks and once you gone through that too, you already built the discipline to go for 3 months and from
            then on you will create a habit and maintain the discipline which will result in achieving your goal. So, in
            my case, I went through the first 3 days and didn’t plan ahead of trying the exercise after 3 days before
            placing this mind-set, and after 3 days, I said to myself to go through for 3 weeks and now I’m on my 5th
            week and I already created this habit so it’s not difficult for me anymore to get up and do it because I
            know how it benefits me in many ways from energizing my body to being positive and relaxed.</p>

        <p>So, I highly recommend you to try out for at least once and see how your body reacts. Also, follow Elliot
            Hulse even though he doesn’t really upload as much but do watch his older videos for spiritual opening for
            the least part. </p>
